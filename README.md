# use-telegram-auth

This repo contains 3 packages that can be used to perform user authentication with Telegram, without using the [Telegram login widget](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login)

- Want to perform the Telegram auth flow in any framework / vanilla js, with a simple async function call? Use [@use-telegram-auth/client](https://github.com/cs-balazs/use-telegram-auth/tree/main/packages/client)

- Want to do the same in React with a single hook call? Use [@use-telegram-auth/hook](https://github.com/cs-balazs/use-telegram-auth/tree/main/packages/hook)

- Want to easily validate the authentication result on the server side? Use [@use-telegram-auth/server](https://github.com/cs-balazs/use-telegram-auth/tree/main/packages/server)
